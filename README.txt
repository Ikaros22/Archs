"Archs is a typing speed test created by me in March 2022 during my first year of IT studies as a 
trainnig for job interview. Everything I know I have learned in Udemy course "NodeJS, the complete guide" 
by Max Schwarzmuller. Styling was downloaded from free-css.com (license in '/public'). Right now Im aware
that this project is not ideal, but over my backend carrier I'm going to improve it step by step. 
App is fully stable and ready to use by bigger amount of users. Hope You will enjoy it. 
Go!
